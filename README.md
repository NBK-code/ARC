# ARC

This is a minimal implementation of the paper The Surprising Effectiveness of Test-Time Training for Few-Shot Learning by Akyurek et. al. 

##Fine-tuning Dataset

We use RE-ARC by Hodel that provides different instantiations of the same task using a Domain Specific Language (DSL).

##Geometric Transformations

We use rotations, flips and transpose to provide data augmentation.
